# Smart-Robot-Navigation-with-Obstacle-Avoidance-in-Unity
This Unity project features a robot navigating autonomously through a 3D environment. It follows a path, avoids obstacles, and finds the best route to its destination. Using Unityâ€™s AI and physics tools, the robot adapts to changes and can move around obstacles. The environment is customizable with waypoints, terrains, and obstacles.
